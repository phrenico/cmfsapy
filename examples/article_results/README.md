# Instructions to reproduce the results in "Manifold-adaptive dimension estimation revisited" article

Here I write down the step-by-step instructions to reproduce the results in the aforementioned article.
The instructions assume that you have a proper installation of cmfsapy in your working environment.
Each figure and the table has a script, which generates it.
Some figures have precomputed data, which can be found in a folder or data-generating scripts are available 
in this folder to obtain the required data.

In the followings I write down how to reproduce the results:

## Generate Figure 1
Run the  fig01_FSA_pdfs.py file to generate the first figure about the
empirical and theoretical probability density functions:
```
python fig01_FSA_pdfs.py
```

## Generate Figure 3

## Generate Figure 4

## Generate Figure 5

## Generate Figure 6
## Generate Figure 7
## Generate Figure S1
## Generate Figure S2
